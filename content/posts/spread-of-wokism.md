From Philip Freemanâ€™s excellent biography of [Alexander the Great](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Great-Philip-Freeman/dp/1416592814):

> Language, as well as politics, culture, and so much else, reinforced the opinion of the Greeks that the Macedonians were a separate people, barbarians from beyond Olympus, no matter how hard their kings might try to behave like Greeks. And to most Macedonians, this was just fine. They saw the Greeks as feeble, effeminate, self-important snobs who had long since squandered whatever manliness and courage they had possessed when they had driven back the Persian invaders more than a century earlier. **The Macedonian nobility might study Greek philosophy and recite the poetry of Homer, but the common Macedonian soldier was proud not to be Greek.**

And yet when Alexander the Great conquered the known world, it was not Macedionian but Greek culture that he spread.
